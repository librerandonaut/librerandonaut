LibreRandonaut is an open-source Android app for generating true random coordinates that allow users to explore their surroundings and perform the activity "randonauting". 

It interfaces with the QRNG at the Australian National University, where it obtains a list of quantum random numbers, converts them to coordinates, and then computes the Gaussian kernel density estimate of those coordinates to find a point with a statistically anomalous density.
